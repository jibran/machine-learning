When I was working as an attorney, I threw up almost every day before work. So many mornings, I would vomit in the sink and then look at myself in the mirror. I looked awful. I was miserable. That career path was slowly killing me.
That life was another lifetime ago. I closed the doors of my small law firm more than thirteen years ago.
These days, I wake up excited. I sing in the shower. I annoy my teenagers with my energy getting ready for the day, and I’m not even a morning person.
I have built a life I love, not through manifestation or magical thinking. I have built my current life through trial-and-error.
Happiness doesn’t come from vision boards or birthday wishes. Happiness comes from intentionally creating a life you love. It comes from taking responsibility for your life.
While I don’t believe in magical thinking or manifesting, I do believe our brains have far more power than we understand. But changing anything in your life requires you to take action, not just vibes. It requires you to take responsibility.
Bad things happen. Sometimes those things are your fault, and sometimes they’re not. Often, things happen to you because of complex systems you have no control over or voice in…
